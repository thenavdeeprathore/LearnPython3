It is an encapsulation mechanism to group related 08_modules into a single unit.

Package is nothing but folder or directory which represents collection of Python 08_modules.

Any folder or directory compulsory contains __init__.py file, is considered as a Python package.

This file can be empty.

A package can contains sub 09_packages also.

NOTE : From Python 3.3 onwards __init__.py file is NOT mandatory in package

The main advantages of package statement are:
1) We can resolve naming conflicts
2) We can identify our components uniquely
3) It improves modularity of the application
4) Readability of the application will improved
5) Maintainability of the application will improved
