7) Assignment Operators:
------------------------
- We can use assignment operator to assign value to the variable.
    Eg: x = 10
- We can combine assignment operator with some other operator to form compound
assignment operator.
    Eg: x += 10 ïƒ  x = x+10

The following is the list of all possible compound assignment 02_operators in Python.
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
//=
**=
&=
|=
^=
>>=
<<=

x = 10
x += 20  # x = x + 20
print(x)  # 30


print(++10)
print(+10)
print(--10)
print(-10)
