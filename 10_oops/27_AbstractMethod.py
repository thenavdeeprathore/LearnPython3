Abstract Method:
---------------
=>  Sometimes we don't know about implementation, still we can declare a method. Such
    types of methods are called abstract methods. i.e abstract method has only declaration
    but not implementation.
=>  In python we can declare abstract method by using @abstractmethod decorator as follows.
=>  @abstractmethod
=>  def m1(self): pass
=>  @abstractmethod decorator present in abc module. Hence compulsory we should
    import abc module, otherwise we will get error.
=>  abc ïƒ  abstract base class module

class Test:

# Child classes are responsible to provide implementation for parent class abstract methods
