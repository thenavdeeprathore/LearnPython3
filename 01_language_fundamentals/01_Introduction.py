# What is Python?
-----------------

    Python is an
        interpreted
        object-oriented
        high-level
        dynamically-typed
    programming language

=> Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time.
=> It's a both Procedure oriented and Object oriented.
=> It's a Dynamically typed programming, not required to declare type for variables.


Python Created by:
------------------
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 while working in NRI in Netherlands.
Python was available to the public officially in Feb 20, 1991


Why Python became popular in 2020?
----------------------------------
1) Simple language and easy to understand
2) Very less code | concise code
3) AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science
4) IoT
For these current market requirement, Python became popular.


Python as all rounder:
----------------------
C                   --> Functional programming language / Procedure oriented
C++, Java           --> Object oriented programming language
Perl, Shell Script  --> Scripting language
Modula-3            --> Modular programming language

Python borrowed features from other programming language:
    Functional programming from --> C
    Oops from --> C++
    Scripting language from --> Perl and Shell script
    Modular programming from --> Modula-3

NOTE: Most of the syntax borrowed from C and ABC language.


Where we can use Python:
-----------------------
    Desktop applications
    Web development (server-side),
    Software development,
    Network applications,
    Gaming applications,
    Data Analysis,
    AI, ML, DL, NN, IoT, DS,
    Mathematics,
    System scripting.

Which company using Python:
--------------------------
    - Google
    - Youtube
    - Amazon
    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - Netflix
    - Uber
    - NASA
    - Spotify
    - Dropbox
    - Yahoo
    - BitTorrent
    - Pinterest
    - Udemy
    - PayPal


Features of Python:
------------------
    1. Simple and easy to learn
    2. Freeware and Open source
    3. High level programming language
    4. Platform independent
    5. Portability
    6. *** Dynamically typed
    7. *** Both Procedure and Object oriented
    8. Interpreted
    9. Extensible
    10. Embedded
    11. *** Extensive Library

Note: Python is not pure Object oriented.
Note: In Python everything is an object

Other features:
---------------
=>  We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed.
    So we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
=>  Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step
    included in Python development.
=>  Python uses new lines to complete a command.
=>  Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope.
    such as the scope of loops, 07_functions and classes.

-------
Java --> Oracle
C#.Net --> Microsoft

Flavours of Python:
-------------------
    CPython
    JPython or Jython
    IronPython
    Pypy
    RubyPython
    AnacondaPython
    Stack-less(Python for concurrency)


Python History and Versions:
----------------------------
    Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
     Python 1.0V introduced in Jan 1994
     Python 2.0V introduced in October 2000
     Python 3.0V introduced in December 2008
    The implementation of Python was started in the December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherlands.
    In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
    In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
    Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.
    On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released.
    It was designed to rectify fundamental flaw of the language.


Limitations of Python:
----------------------
1) Performance wise not up to the mark because it is an interpreted language.
2) Not using for mobile Applications.
3) Not using for enterprise application
    - banking
    - telecommunication
