# Assertions

"""
Debugging Python Program by using assert Keyword:

☕ The process of identifying and fixing the bug is called debugging.

☕ Very common way of debugging is to use print() statement. But the problem with the
print() statement is after fixing the bug, compulsory we have to delete the extra added
print() statements, otherwise these will be executed at runtime which creates
performance problems and disturbs console output.

☕ To overcome this problem we should go for assert statement. The main advantage of
assert statement over print() statement is after fixing bug we are not required to
delete assert statements. Based on our requirement we can enable or disable assert
statements.

☕ Hence the main purpose of assertions is to perform debugging. Usually we can perform
debugging either in development or in test environments but not in production
environment.
Hence assertions concept is applicable only for dev and test environments
but not for production environment.
